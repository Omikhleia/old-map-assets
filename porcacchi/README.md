Cities and mountains from Tomaso Porcacchi's "Descrittione dell'Isola d'Islanda" (1572).

The "city8" is from another source, and slightly modified, but I found it interesting to go along this collection for some "unexpected" variety.

The trees (forests) are from another source too. I can't recollect from which old map they were taken, but found them to match decently the other assets. Quite obviously, Iceland doesn't really have forests, so Porcacchi's map is nearly devoid of vegetation.
