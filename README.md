# old-map-assets

This repository contains SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) assets derived from a few ancient maps.

There have been times when I've had to quickly design maps or schematics for a role-playing game or fantasy story.
I wanted them to look like real maps, as they were presented between the 15th and 18th centuries.
What better way than to draw inspiration from the great cartographers and draughtsmen of yesteryear?
